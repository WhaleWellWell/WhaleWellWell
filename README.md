Hi, my name is **Whale Well Well** and I am 13 years old! I am a self taught Jr. developer, and have taken many online courses on **Edx**, **Codecadamy**, **The Odin Project**, **Github**, and **Pluralsight**. Over the past couple years, I have learned many programming languages, including: 

- ```Html``` ( Also ```PUG``` )
- ```Css``` ( And ```SASS``` )
- ```JavaScript```
- ```Python``` ( and some of ```Pygame``` too! )
- ```C++``` (```C#```)
- ```Shell``` ( ```Bash``` )
- I also know how to use ```JQuery``` and ```Bootstrap```.
