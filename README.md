# Hello! ðŸ‘‹
Hi, my name is **Whale Well Well** and I am 13 years old! I am a self taught Jr. developer, and have taken several online courses on **Edx**, **Codecadamy**, **The Odin Project**, and **Github**. Over the past couple years, I have learned many programming languages, including: 

- ```Html``` ( Also ```PUG``` )
- ```Css``` ( And ```SASS``` )
- ```JavaScript```
- ```Python``` ( ```Pygame``` too! )
- ```C++```
- ```Shell``` ( ```Bash``` )
- I also know how to use ```JQuery``` and ```Bootstrap```.

I hope to learn ```Rust```, ```Vue```, and ```C#```, but haven't had the time just yet.
